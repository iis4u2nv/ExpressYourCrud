## Acceptance Criteria

Presume you create a functional Express.js that has API keys. The first thing to do is add your database name, MYSQL username, 
an MYSQL password to the environment variable file to be able to connect to a database using Sequelize. An insertion for schema 
and seed commands will be needed to be able to create a development database seeded with test data. As you enter the command to
invoke the application the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MYSQL database. As you open API GET routes
in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. As you 
test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia you will be able to successfully create, update, and delete data in your database.
